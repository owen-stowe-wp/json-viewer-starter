# JSON Viewer project
This is a starter repo for a coding project the Warby Parker web team uses to evaluate candidates appying to engineering roles.

Warby Parker uses a custom-built CMS to power the majority of content on the warbyparker.com website. This CMS is essentially a fancy JSON editor and, as such, it requires a way to easily view json. Denis, the creator of the CMS, wasn't able to find a library for this purpose that met our needs, so he ended up building one himself. The main features are as follows:
* Displays JSON in a readable format
* Expand / collapse UI for objects and arrays
* UI supports highlighting and copying valid JSON to clipboard

An example of what this looks like can be found [here, in Denis' gihub](https://denis-nikolayev-warby.github.io/)

The ideal end state for this project contains the following:
* Readable JSON
* Expand / collapse functionality
* Typescript types
* More polied CSS is nice to have, but not a requirement
